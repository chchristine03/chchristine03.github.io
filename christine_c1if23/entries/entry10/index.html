<div class="text">
  In the tapestry of life, a subtle art,
<br>Where meanings lie, concealed, apart.
<br>Beneath the surface, a hidden dance,
<br>Whispers of beauty in life's expanse.
<br>
<br>In moments fleeting, like shadows cast,
<br>Appreciation blooms, a spell so vast.
<br>Behind the veil of the ordinary,
<br>Lies a tapestry, rich and extraordinary.
<br>
<br>Within a smile, a universe unfolds,
<br>In laughter's echo, stories untold.
<br>Each heartbeat, a rhythm of gratitude,
<br>A melody composed in quiet solitude.
<br>
<br>Amidst the chaos, a serenade profound,
<br>In every silence, wisdom is found.
<br>Nature whispers secrets to the keen,
<br>A dance of symbols, yet unseen.
<br>
<br>In the flutter of a butterfly's wing,
<br>A symphony of existence begins to sing.
<br>The rustle of leaves, a timeless rhyme,
<br>Echoes of eternity in the folds of time.
<br>
<br>The sunrise paints a canvas divine,
<br>Colors of hope in each design.
<br>In the mundane, the sacred conceals,
<br>A revelation that the heart feels.
<br>
<br>Behind each trial, a lesson veiled,
<br>In every challenge, strength unveiled.
<br>The meaning hidden, like a gem,
<br>In the tapestry, life weaves its emblem.
<br>
<br>So, let us seek the treasures concealed,
<br>In the beauty of moments, unrevealed.
<br>For in the appreciation of life's sweet art,
<br>We find the hidden meanings that impart.
